## Maxamed Daud

maxamed.daud@powercoders.org

Every Software developer starts from the junior position, of course with me was the same, 
but this is a just first step in the exciting journey and nobody knows when will end and who we will be after. I want to share my journey and stories from it, maybe you want to share your experience? Feel free to discuss, find mistakes, find better ways, because this is the best way to learn from each other..
